How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
-I was able to easily pinpoint the difference, figure out what was added or removed, and detect any possible errors due to the changes.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
-it's good for backtracking, spotting mistakes you commonly make, and seeing your development througout the project.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
-pros: Not clustered, will be easier to go through. Adding comments will give context.
-cons: Subjective.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Depends on the nature of where they're applied, I think.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
Down key to scroll log, git diff 1st_item 2nd_item
and change the color mode

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
-You can always go back.


Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
-College projects and contributing to open source projects.
